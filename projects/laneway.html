				<h2>Design Challenge</h2>
				<p>As part of an initiative to thoughtfully increase density in Toronto, laneway houses are being considered. This laneway house is located in the Junction Triangle and is surrounded by neighbours’ backyards and sheds. The Smiths hope this home will be able to accommodate their current lifestyle as well as any future needs that may arise. The proposed design will be a unique building, designed to address the site's many challenges and opportunities.</p>

				<h2>Approach</h2>
				<p>Many of the houses in the neighbourhood are built in traditional styles. This contrasts the straight lines and clean surfaces of the Smiths Residence. To blend into the surroundings, brick is used as the primary cladding material to reference older houses and shops in the area that also use brick. To reduce the visual weight, the structure tapers towards the top making the most visible part of the house appear lighter. While the house blends into the neighbourhood, the property is separated from the surroundings by a perimeter brick wall. This creates a sense of safety and shelter despite the proximity to a laneway and numerous sheds. As first impressions are important, the entry to the property is covered by a wooden pergola to further the feeling of shelter. The common space inside is kept open and faces a large wall of glass which brings in ample natural light. The wall opens up to a secluded courtyard. When open, the inside will seamlessly blend into the outside extending the living space while encouraging time outdoors. The courtyard itself is enclosed by the house and the perimeter brick wall and has space for outdoor cooking as well as space for a small table and chairs for an intimate dining or lounging experience. For larger gatherings, the covered parking space on the north side of the property will be transformed into an expansive outdoor entertainment area. The private areas of the house are separated from these lively areas through hallways and separate levels. The office is nestled in the north-east corner of the house tucked behind the living room. Along with privacy, this location allows for an entrance directly into the room from the front porch which is ideal when meeting clients or for guests wanting to come and go with minimal disruption. The bedrooms are stacked above on the second and third floors with views of the tree canopy and the home’s green roof. This green roof adds extra insulation and reduces the property's impact on the runoff water infrastructure. As it is an infill project, special consideration has been put into the amount of permeable and absorbing surfaces used so the area remains able to retain water. The Smiths will also appreciate the flexibility of this design. Many of the rooms are built with regular proportions which makes it easier to transition from one use to another. The unfinished basement also allows for the family to expand as needed.</p>
