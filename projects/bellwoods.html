				<h2>Design Challenge</h2>
				<p>As a grade 12 architecture claas project, I was asked to rejuvinate the Trinity Bellwoods Comunity Center by creating a new entrence. My design takes into account accessibility, environmental, and seasonal factors to address a lack of covered areas in the park which currently leaves users with no options when the weather turns wet. The design will remain versatile by focusing on two simple ideas allowing the space to be easily adapted to fit the needs of many users.</p>

				</div>

				<h2>The Amphitheatre</h2>
				<p>The first of two ideas is an integrated ramp, stairway, and amphitheatre. The structure is comprised of three stairways and a ramp. Two of the stairways allow for quick access to the site’s periphery while the other faces south and acts as the main access. The ramp weaves in and out with the main stairway reducing the stigma associated with barrier-free design as well as connecting the ramp to the stairway and the amphitheatre. The experience is amplified by a wildflower garden found midway up the ramp that will attract both pollinators and nature lovers. Facing an open plaza-like area, the connected amphitheatre serves as a flexible gathering place suitable for individuals or large groups such as day camps or concerts.</p>

				</div>

				<h2>The Pavilions</h2>
				<p>The site is shaped by three pavilions. Their placement creates walkways that span across the site as well as help to frame the plaza-like area adjacent to the amphitheatre. The strategic placing of the pavilions and walkways gives views of the site from the sides of the community center while not showing the whole site. This encourages further exploration, revealing the entirety of the design. The pavilions will be populated with chairs and tables as well as picnic tables. The variety of seating will provide a covered area for any occasion. For special events, the seating underneath the pavilion will be removed and the area transformed into a covered area able to be adapted into the event. One such use would be a covered area for vendors to display artworks out of during the famous Art in the Park. The pavilions’ shape references the ramp while also creating a varied feel underneath. The high sections feel more open and energetic while the lower sections feel more intimate and personal.</p>

				<h2>An Environmentally Aware System</h2>
				<p>Toronto is often referred to as an up-side-down San Fransisco due to the abundance of ravines. While these ravines were created by streams and rivers, the water has largely been piped and buried under roads and houses. One such waterway used to flow directly through where Trinity Bellwoods Park is now located and was known as Garrison Creek. The result of this unnatural intervention can be seen after heavy rain when sewage pipes overflow and low-level areas such as the islands flood. The entrance to Trinity Bellwoods Park will address this environmental issue by incorporating rainwater collection into the pavilion and ramp. Rainwater from these areas will be directed into nearby rain gardens to be slowly absorbed into the ground while irrigating vegetation that will be appreciated by wildlife and community members alike.</p>

				</div>

				<h2>A Place to Sit</h2>
				<p>One of the most desired qualities in Toronto is a place to sit. An easy request to fill, ample seating is found under the three pavilions and amphitheatre. As well, benches follow the walkways adding seating to even more areas. In total there is seating for well over 200 people at once.</p>

				</div>

				<h2>A Happy Place</h2>
				<p>Many people’s image of a city involves out-of-scale, monotone, look-a-like buildings. To contrast this grim reality, each pavilion as well as the ramps and stairs will be enhanced with bright colours. The colour will be visible throughout the year and will be especially appreciated during the winter when the world seems to become different shades of grey. The two pavilions near the center of the site will also have an interactive sculpture built-in. The pillars holding the roofs up will be bent towards the other pavilion continuing the roofline. The pillars will be easily accessible and will encourage people to walk through the sculpture to experience it from new perspectives. From the amphitheatre, the sculpture will act as an interesting backdrop to the plaza, and from Queen Street, the sculpture will frame the entryway. The playful design will be a welcomed relief to the rest of the city.</p>

				</div>

				<h2>Built for the Seasons</h2>
				<p>This entryway will remain a desirable location throughout the winter months. Along with the colour from the built structures, coniferous trees placed against the community center will add colour. While deciduous trees lose their leaves, the coniferous trees will remain green through the winter. Deciduous trees still play a role in the sustained enjoyment by acting as a seasonal sunshade. During the summer, the leaves will block harsh sunlight keeping the site cooler, while in the winter the leaves will drop allowing in more light which will keep the site warmer. By harnessing the power of trees, this site will be enjoyed both summer and winter.</p>

				</div>

				<h2>Safety Above All</h2>
				<p>The most important aspect of any design is the safety of its users. The site line is kept clear of obstructions so people can both see and be seen at all times. As well, lights covering the entire site will keep the area bright after the sun has set. These measures will ensure everybody can safely enjoy the new space anytime they wish.</p>
