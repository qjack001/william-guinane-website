				<h2>Design Challenge</h2>
				<p>For a grade 11 architecture class project, submissions were to made for a fictional development project in the Port Lands area being run by the City of Toronto. As the area was previously occupied by an active port, three forty-foot shipping containers would be provided as a building material. Using these three containers, an innovative structure suitable to house a family of three was to be built.</p>

				<h2>Approach</h2>
				<p>The three containers were positioned around a tree to create individual wings that house different functions. Along with the centralized tree; large windows, built-in planters, and generous outdoor space help to bring nature into downtown Toronto’s concrete jungle. To reduce rainwater runoff flowing directly into and polluting Lake Ontario, a green roof covers much of the house’s footprint. The remaining space is topped with solar panels to lessen the house’s net energy consumption.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Although I have thought about and created house designs many times before, this project represents my first practice producing a finished product. I am fairly pleased with the result and feel I have learned valuable lessons that I have applied in later projects and throughout my life.</p>

				<p>Building the foam model, like other aspects of the process, took long hours of high focus. To do this properly required respect and patience. Reflecting on my progress midway through the construction of the model, I realized I wasn’t happy with the quality. As it was to late to restart the model and meet the hard deadline, I was forced to use what I had built, but I was more thoughtful and patient in constructing the remaining model. Unfortunately, I was not able to salvage it and was stuck handing in something I was not proud of making. This experience continues to serve as a reminder of the power a little bit of patience can have.</p>

				<p>Fresh off the disappointment with my foam model, I decided I should redeem myself by experimenting with digital models and renderings. To do this I primarily used SketchUp and Twinmotion. I had little experience using either software going into the project, so I had to learn everything before I did it. One thing I did not learn early enough was the importance of organization, which allows for faster and easier editing. By not having any system in place to stay organized, small edits I wanted to make later in the prosses became daunting tasks, some scary enough to stop me from attempting. I am still satisfied with my first attempt, despite the changes I never made. Learning from this project, I have created and implemented organizational systems for all my projects since. As well it has taught me the importance of planning ahead, something I have carried through to other parrots of my life.</p>
